Speech Emotion Recognition
Introduction
This repository handles building and training Speech Emotion Recognition System.
The basic idea behind this tool is to build and train/test a suited machine learning ( as well as deep learning ) algorithm that could recognize and detects human emotions from speech.
This is useful for many industry fields such as making product recommendations, affective computing, etc.
Check this tutorial for more information.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Python Packages
tensorflow
librosa==0.6.3
numpy
pandas
soundfile==0.9.0
wave
scikit-learn==0.24.2
tqdm==4.28.1
matplotlib==2.2.3
pyaudio==0.2.11
ffmpeg (optional): used if you want to add more sample audio by converting to 16000Hz sample rate and mono channel which is provided in convert_wavs.py
Install these libraries by the following command:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
This repository used 4 datasets (including this repo's custom dataset) which are downloaded and formatted already in data folder:

RAVDESS : The Ryson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song that contains 24 actors (12 male, 12 female), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent.
TESS : Toronto Emotional Speech Set that was modeled on the Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 (NU-6; Tillman & Carhart, 1966). A set of 200 target words were spoken in the carrier phrase "Say the word _____' by two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years).
EMO-DB : As a part of the DFG funded research project SE462/3-1 in 1997 and 1999 we recorded a database of emotional utterances spoken by actors. The recordings took place in the anechoic chamber of the Technical University Berlin, department of Technical Acoustics. Director of the project was Prof. Dr. W. Sendlmeier, Technical University of Berlin, Institute of Speech and Communication, department of communication science. Members of the project were mainly Felix Burkhardt, Miriam Kienast, Astrid Paeschke and Benjamin Weiss.
Custom : Some unbalanced noisy dataset that is located in data/train-custom for training and data/test-custom for testing in which you can add/remove recording samples easily by converting the raw audio to 16000 sample rate, mono channel (this is provided in create_wavs.py script in convert_audio(audio_path) method which requires ffmpeg to be installed and in PATH) and adding the emotion to the end of audio file name separated with '_' (e.g "20190616_125714_happy.wav" will be parsed automatically as happy)
Emotions available
There are 9 emotions available: "neutral", "calm", "happy" "sad", "angry", "fear", "disgust", "ps" (pleasant surprise) and "boredom".

Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is the main part of the speech emotion recognition system. It is basically accomplished by changing the speech waveform to a form of parametric representation at a relatively lesser data rate.

In this repository, we have used the most used features that are available in librosa library including:

MFCC
Chromagram
MEL Spectrogram Frequency (mel)
Contrast
Tonnetz (tonal centroid features)
