# Speech Emotion Recognition

### Introduction

- This repository handles building and training Speech Emotion Recognition System.
- The basic idea behind this tool is to build and train/test a suited machine learning ( as well as deep learning ) algorithm that could recognize and detects human emotions from speech.
- This is useful for many industry fields such as making product recommendations, affective computing, etc.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is the main part of the speech emotion recognition system. It is basically accomplished by changing the speech waveform to a form of parametric representation at a relatively lesser data rate
In this repository, we have used the following features
- MFCC
- Chorma
## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository 

```
git@github.com:spilabkorea/ser.git
```
Install the libraries by the following command
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
features extraction

To extract the MFCC and Chroma features run
```
preprocessing files
```
Train the models
for the model trainining run the training scripts
